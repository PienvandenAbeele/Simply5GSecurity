# TO DO

Security activation, just like AKA, already existed in previous network generations and 5G improves on this further. What SA does is:
Enables Ciphering and Integrity Protection
Access Stratum: RRC Security Mode Command / Complete → Protection on PDCP
Non-Access Stratum: NAS Security Mode Command / Complete → Protection on NAS
New:
Initial NAS Message Protection
User Plane Integrity Protection
