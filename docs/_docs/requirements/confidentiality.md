#### Definition of Confidentiality:
*The protection of data, provides access for those who are allowed to see it while disallowing others from learning anything about its content.*

In the mobile network, confidentiality is important to ensure no one but the required parties can see the information. For example, when calling a loved one, if an attacker were to snoop around on the network, they can see the traffic, but do not know what it says or who it is for. This is established by encrypting the traffic data.

| Confidentiality of User Data Traffic (UDT)        |  By ensuring the confidentiality of the UDT, only the people who are allowed to, will be able to see the data traffic of a user. For everyone else, this data (e.g. how much the user sends) will be encrypted and unavailable.                | Interception of Internet traffic | Network Access Security 33.501 - 6.6.2 |
| Confidentiality of Voice/Video Calls         | By ensuring the confidentiality of voice/video calls, these calls will be encrypted; thus, only the receiver and sender will be able to see and hear the information being exchanged.                | Eavesdropping Phone Calls | |
| Confidentiality of text messages (SMS) / RCS | By ensuring the confidentiality of voice/video calls, these calls will be encrypted; thus, only the receiver and sender will be able to see and hear the information being exchanged.                | Interception of text messages / RCS | |
| Location privacy                             | By ensuring the confidentiality of voice/video calls, these calls will be encrypted; thus, only the receiver and sender will be able to see and hear the information being exchanged.                | User localization | |
| Identity privacy                             | By ensuring the confidentiality of voice/video calls, these calls will be encrypted; thus, only the receiver and sender will be able to see and hear the information being exchanged.                | User identification & tracking | |
