#### Definition of Integrity:
*Systems and data are available to individuals when they need them under any circumstances, including power outages or natural disasters.*

Availability in the mobile network makes the network always available to everyone. An important example of this is when there is a power outage, a lot of accidents can happen and thus it is very important people are still able to call the emergency line.
