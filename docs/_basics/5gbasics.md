5G is the fifth generation of wireless technology for digital cellular networks. It is designed to provide **faster** and **more reliable** wireless connections, **higher capacity** for more devices, and **lower latency** (time for a packet to arrive to its destination). Those features will provide a better support for a wide range of (new) applications, including the internet of things (IoT), remote surgery, self-driving cars, and more.

Implementation of those features and applications introduces a complex network architectures, which in turn introduces a larger potential attack surface. Along with the increased complexity 5G networks are also used for a wider range of critical applications and services, including critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things (IoT). Those critical applications are an attractive targets for attackers.
Therefore, it is important all stakeholders, like the 3GPP, the manufactors and the network operators, make sure the network has the essential measures to ensure a secure network. On top of the essential security features, 5G also introduces new security measures, like <a href="{{ "/docs/identification/" | relative_url }}">SUCI</a> and <a href="{{ "/docs/oauth/" | relative_url }}">OAuth 2.0</a>. 
To understand the (new) security features, we will first go over the 5G network architecture, to gain understanding of how the different components work together. Then we will take a look at the different components in more depth, including their security aspects.

### Who are the 3GPP?
Throughout our website, we often mention the <a href="https://www.3gpp.org">3GPP</a>, which is a 3rd Generation Partnership Project. They unite telecommunications standards to a standard known as the 3GPP standard. Everyone can follow the 3GPP standards when implementing, for example a 5G core, and they will have the certainty is they follow the specifications, the system will work accordingly.
