5G is the successor of 4G and the next mobile network generation. With the introduction of 5G, the mobile network improves in a lot of areas:

* Higher data speeds
* Lower latency
* More reliability
* More network capacity
* More availability

This also introduces more complexity to the network, which introduces more possible security risks. Services like SUCI (link to page) and Oauth (link to page) are there to ensure more security on the network.
But first, we will focus on explaining the 5G Architecture, and the function of all the components.
